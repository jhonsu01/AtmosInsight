# üåç **AtmosInsight: Visualizing Earth, Listening to the Climate**
**Omnicron Animate ‚Äì NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025**

## 1. A Story Born from Space

For over half a century, NASA has observed our planet as never before ‚Äî from space, through thousands of technological eyes that orbit and record every change in the atmosphere, soil, vegetation, and oceans.

However, while satellites capture terabytes of data every day, much of this information remains hidden behind technical portals, complex formats, and scientific jargon that few can understand.

That‚Äôs where **AtmosInsight** was born ‚Äî a tool that translates satellite science into human stories, combining interactive visualization with accessible narration.
Its goal is simple: to help anyone, regardless of technical background, understand what satellites see and *listen* to what Earth is trying to tell us.

## 2. The Challenge

The challenge that inspired this project was:

> ‚ÄúHow can Earth observation data be made understandable, engaging, and useful for everyone?‚Äù

Most scientific portals present raw data ‚Äî maps, indexes, coordinates, graphs.
But behind every pixel lies a story: a spreading drought, a forest breathing less, or a sulfur dioxide plume revealing a volcano awakening.

**AtmosInsight** proposes a new way to tell environmental science stories by combining spatial visualization, digital storytelling, and artificial intelligence.

## 3. Our Solution:

### Interactive Visualization + Audio Narrative

AtmosInsight is a web application that connects directly to **NASA‚Äôs open APIs**, especially **GIBS (Global Imagery Browse Services)**, to bring real-time satellite imagery and reconstruct the evolution of atmospheric and terrestrial phenomena.

The user can:

* Select a date or historical event (e.g., a hurricane or pollution peak).
* Choose a satellite layer such as:

  * NDVI (Vegetation)
  * SMAP (Soil Moisture)
  * SO‚ÇÇ (Volcanic Emissions)
  * Surface Water (OPERA)
  * Temperature or visible imagery (MODIS Terra)
* Visualize the information on a map and observe temporal changes.
* Listen to an AI-generated narration that explains the phenomenon in clear, educational language.

Thus, the experience doesn‚Äôt just display data ‚Äî it tells stories about how Earth breathes, changes, and adapts.
